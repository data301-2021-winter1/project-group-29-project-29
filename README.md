## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Everyone in our group had an interest in a dataset based on mental health since it's been such a big topic since the pandemic. We chose a data set that has implications on the general population of the USA from COVID-19. I would want to explore what factors caused certain states to face higher levels of mental health symptoms than others. Also I think it would be interesting to see what parts (east vs. middle vs. west or north vs. south) of country was impacted as whole and why that part was affected more heavily than the other side. I think building a user-facing dashboard with this material will be very interesting since there are so many factors that could contribute to mental health rates. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was collected by the US Census Bureau and is hosted publicly on the US Government open data website, data.gov. The data provided was produced from surveys focused on the social and economic impact of COVID-19 on American Households. All the data was collected throughout the middle of 2020 and was first published on November 9, 2020, and has since been updated on January 6, 2020. The purpose of this dataset is for scientific research and education, to provide an insight on the impact of the pandemic by gauging the participant’s employment status, education disruptions, physical and mental health, etc. The data was collected by an internet questionnaire, where participants were sent an invitation through email and text message.
